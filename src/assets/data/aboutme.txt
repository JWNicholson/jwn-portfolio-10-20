I'm a fullstack engineer, specializing in React, Express,Node,Redux,Python, and SQL.
I also have skills in Visual Design, and WordPress development. Creating things that 
are useful and nice to look at is what drives me, so coding was a natural next-step.
 I am looking for fulltime work, but will also consider a part-time or contract gig.
